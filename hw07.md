# 1、Program with machine language according to the following c. 
int_8 a = 1; <br/> 
int_8 c = a + 3;<br/>

## 1）Write your assembly code & machine code 

LDA 0x0001, i <br/>
STA 0x008B, d  <br/>
LDA 0x0003, i  <br/>
ADDA 0x008B, d <br/>
STA 0x008C, d<br/>

11000000 0000000000000001 <br/>
11100001 0000000010001011<br/>
11000000 0000000000000011<br/>
01110001 0000000010001011<br/>
11100001 0000000010001100<br/>

## 2）Explain machine code execution with the fetch-decode-execute cycle 

从内存里取指令，在解码器里解码，然后执行

## 3）Explain functions about  IR, PC, ACC registers in a CPU 

IR里存着此次CPU执行的指令<br/>
PC里存着下次CPU要执行的指令的内存地址<br/>
ACC作为寄存器临时保存数据<br/>

## 4）Explain physical meaning about vars a & c in a machine

为a，c两个变量开辟内存空间

# 2、简答题
## 1）What are stored in memory? 
A:<br/>
Data and instructions

## 2）Can a data or a instruction stored in the same place? 
A:<br/>
Physically yes, but the address of data is always different from an instruction's.

## 3） Explain Instruction Format with example instructions.
A:<br/>
000XZZZ  bbbbbbbb<br/>
**X** means the addressing mode, direct or immediate mode<br/>
**ZZZ** is the operation code<br/>
**bbbbbbbb** could be a direct number or an address of numbers.

# 3、解释以下词汇 
A:<br/>
